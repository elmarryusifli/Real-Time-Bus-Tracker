# Real-time-Bus-Tracker-for-Boston-city

## Description
The Bus Tracking Application is a web-based project that displays real-time bus locations on a map using the Google Maps API. It provides a visual representation of the buses on a specified route, updating their positions every few seconds. The application features the following improvements:

- Real-time bus tracking with markers that update dynamically on the map.
- Clearing of previous bus markers before adding new ones, providing an accurate representation of the current bus locations.

## How to Run
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bus-tracking-app.git

1) Open the project directory in your code editor.

2) Obtain a Google Maps API key from the Google Cloud Console, and replace YOUR_API_KEY in index.html with your actual API key:
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap" async defer></script>

3) Open index.html in a web browser to view the bus tracking application.

Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to make the following improvements to the Bus Tracking Application:

- Add bus route information and additional details on the map.
- Provide real-time updates on bus arrival times and routes.
- Implement user-friendly controls and options for customizing the map view.
- Enhance the user interface and user experience.
- These improvements aim to make the application more informative and user-friendly.
